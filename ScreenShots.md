# Testrunner #

This application automatically runs all the test cases in every committed Mercurial revision and presents the results graphically. The front page gives an overview of the branches in the Mercurial repository:

Clicking on a revision gives details on the tests:

We also have a module for visualizing the Mercurial repository to make it easier to see where failing tests got introduced as well as where branches were merged:
