The Spider Web Framework is a framework for building web applications in Java. It was developed with a set of specific goals:

  * Make it trivially easy to write good test cases
  * Reduce boilerplate code to a minimum
  * Avoid static state through dependency injection
  * Strict M-V-C separation
  * Prefer convention over configuration

Also worth mentioning is that the framework itself is small, about 10 classes and interfaces and a little over 1000 lines of code. The JAR file includes the (well documented) source code and it is thus easy to understand what is going on.

Spider was developed by the engineers at [Medallia](http://medallia.com); see SpiderHistory for more info on how it was developed.

See SpiderIntroduction for an introduction to Spider, GettingStarted for how to get started quickly and CalculatorSampleApplication for a guided tour on how to write a simple application.
